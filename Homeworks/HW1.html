<!-- Homework Responses:

1). If connected to the internet by an ISP, when a user inputs a URL into a browser's address bar, the browser will take the user to a DNS. The DNS looks up the IP address of 
the requested domain name and sends the user to that location. Finally, the web server sends the requested page and its information/data to the computer.

   ISP - an internet service provider. Examples include Yahoo and Comcast. 
   URL - uniform resource locator. The address used to access resources/information on the internet.
   DNS - domain names system/server. A DNS server is a director that helps computers find the IP address of a webpage using the human-readable URL.
   Web Server - a computer system that hosts websites and delivers information to users.

2). HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create webpages and describe their structures.

3). Fordham's home page uses structure to simplify its information and make the page user friendly. The primary resources are all located at the top of the page in a header, making 
the links obvious to the user; each section is visually distinct and images and text specify the purpose of each piece of information. The top links also have drop-down menus, so as to simplify the main 
page and not clutter it with information. The less relevant information is smaller and not at the top of the page. Fordham also utilizes solely white, maroon, black, and gray on the page as those are the school's colors and they keep the page consistent.

4). HTML elements are characters inside angled brackets. They consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The elements give the web browser information about the content inside the brackets.
The opening tag contains the name of the element, while the closing tag contains a forward slash before the name. Attributes provide more information about the elements and can modify their behavior, such as with
the 'style' attribute, which can be used along with 'color' to set the font color.
